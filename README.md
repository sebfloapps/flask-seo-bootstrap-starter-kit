# Flask SEO Bootstrap Starter Kit

This is a lightweight Flask starter kit I built from patterns I’ve reused across real production projects for years — mainly SaaS platforms and automotive marketing, GPS, and analytics systems.

It’s meant to be a clean foundation that handles the basics so you can focus on building your actual app instead of rebuilding the same starting structure over and over.

---

## What This Is

This project is intentionally minimal. It provides:

- Clean Flask app structure using blueprints
- SEO-ready HTML templates
- OpenGraph and social meta tags built in
- Bootstrap 5 layout for quick UI setup
- Simple base routing and templating setup

No heavy frameworks, no over-engineering — just a solid starting point that mirrors how I actually build production projects.

## Roadmap

Right now this is focused on core structure and layout only. As I continue to build on it over time, I plan to add more sample pages and example models.


The goal is to keep expanding without turning it into bloated boilerplate.
