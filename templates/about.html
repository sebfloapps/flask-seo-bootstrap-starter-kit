  <h1 class="mb-4">About This Starter Kit</h1>

  <p>
    This starter kit is a lightweight foundation for Flask projects built from
    patterns I’ve reused across real production systems — mainly web platforms
    and SaaS tools in automotive marketing, GPS, and analytics.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is not to be a full framework or a bloated boilerplate. This is
    designed to stay small, clear, and production-minded while still covering
    the essential setup most projects need.
  </p>

  <h2 class="h4 mt-4 mb-3">Goals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep structure clean and understandable.</li>
    <li>Provide an SEO-friendly layout from day one.</li>
    <li>Stay flexible without over-engineering.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="h4 mt-4 mb-3">Roadmap</h2>
  <p>
    Over time I plan to expand this kit with example pages for things like
    authentication, dashboards, and contact workflows — but always keeping
    the foundation lean.
